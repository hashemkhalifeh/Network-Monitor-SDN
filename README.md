# Network-Monitor-SDN
# Introduction
This project consists of a Software Defined Network (SDN) of 3 hosts connected using 5 switches. The objective is to generate, monitor and measure real time SDN traffic and manage traffic flows in real time based on traffic measurement. The goal is to manage flows in real time such that all links in the network are as evenly loaded as possible based on traffic measurements. 

# Details
The experiment is executed using mininet installed on a Ubuntu VM on VirtualBox. Mininet creates a scalable SDN using OpenFlow on a single PC. Our network topology consisted of 3 hosts connected using 5 switches and a RYU controller to manage traffic. The topology is shown in the image below.
